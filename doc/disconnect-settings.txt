TASKS
- check initial app setup
- jnlp
-- what happens if the cache is cleared and then a snapshot jnlp is requested?
-- 'new' action of admin project needs to be updated
- url & name
-- update the UI to have flag for "active"
-- add url checking when loading settings (this was done by project model validation)
- other project stuff
-- review the usage of state_and_provinces to figure out if that can be simplified
-- need make sure that enable_default_users is correctly handled on app startup now that it only in settings.yml
-- add states and provinces checking on settings load similar to old validations in project model
-- make UI for making grades active if there isn't one already (this can be independent of the other stuff)

- see if there is a way to break the changes into smaller steps that get to the end goal
- test what happens when setting up a new app, currently it won't have a project created, so we might need to fix something to handle that
- after merging in updates from Aaron and rails3.0, need to rerun tests and some of the manual checks below

COMPLETED
- do not optimize jnlp lookups because they just make things more complicated
- leave the current approach to so the snapshot jnlp is updated when ever jnlps are worked with, it will no longer update the snapshot when the default project is updated because that doesn't happen anymore.
- look for references to the project model for the maven information and see if they can go through the jnlp adapter instead
- check all references to current_project
- check all references to static Admin::Project to make sure they are still valid
- create migration to strip no longer used properties from database and replace the accessors in the model with ones that read from the settings, also this should add in some 'active' flag to the project model which is used to to find the active one instead of linking url and name
-- remove name
-- remove url
-- remove enable_default_users
-- remove states_and_provences
-- remove maven_jnlp_server_id
-- remove maven_jnlp_family_id
-- remove jnlp_version_str
-- remove snapshot_enabled
-- add active

STILL need to check
- check if anything is writing into the states_and_provences in the model
- what to do with the maven_jnlp db stuff:
   t.integer  "maven_jnlp_server_id"
    t.integer  "maven_jnlp_family_id"
    t.string   "jnlp_version_str"
    t.boolean  "snapshot_enabled"
-- that is duplicated by the settings: 
--- default_maven_jnlp
-- additionally there are settings which list the families and servers, and it is those lists that are imported at some point and then there are references in the project model to the active server, family, and version
-- the clean thing to do would be to remove the db fields and just use the settings file for this, in which case we might need to optimize some of the lookups 
- check for references to settings that will be removed:
-- description

NOT planning to do
- tests of the settings and project model????
-- it would be nice to have a test that setups up a portal from scratch with a fixed settings.yml and a clean database and then checks the settings file and checks the portal.
