Feature: Investigations show the offerings count
  So I can see how many times an investigation has been assigned
  As a teacher
  I want to see the offerings count

  Background:
    Given The default project and jnlp resources exist using factories
    Given the following teachers exist:
      | login   | password |
      | teacher | teacher  |
    And the following classes exist:
      | name     | teacher |
      | My Class | teacher |
    And I login with username: teacher password: teacher

  Scenario: The investigations list can show the offerings count
    Given the following empty investigations exist:
      | name    | user      | offerings_count | created_at                      | publication_status  |
      | Newest  | teacher   | 5               | Wed Jan 26 12:00:00 -0500 2011  | published           |
      | Medium  | teacher   | 10              | Wed Jan 23 12:00:00 -0500 2011  | published           |
      | Oldest  | teacher   | 20              | Wed Jan 20 12:00:00 -0500 2011  | published           |
    When I show offerings count on the investigations page
    Then I should see "assigned 5 times"
    And I should see "assigned 10 times"
    And I should see "assigned 20 times"

    When I am on the investigations page
    Then I should see "Previous"
    And I should see "Next"
    When I check "show count:"
    And I wait for all pending requests to complete
    Then I should see "assigned 5 times"
    And I should see "assigned 10 times"
    And I should see "assigned 20 times"
    When I follow "Next"
    Then I should see "assigned 11 times"
    And I should see "assigned 6 times"
    And I should see "assigned 22 times"
    And I should see "assigned 33 times"
    And the checkbox for "show count:" should be checked
    When I uncheck "show count:"
    Then I should see "21"
    But I should not see "assigned 11 times"
