    When I am on the investigations page
    Then the checkbox for "drafts too:" should not be checked
    And I should see "Investigation1"
    But I should not see "Investigation2"
    When I check "drafts too:"
    And I wait for all pending requests to complete
    Then I should see "Previous"
    And I should see "Next"
    And I should see "Investigation1"
    And I should see "Investigation2"
    And I should see "Investigation3"
    When I follow "Next"
    Then I should see "Investigation21"
    And I should see "Investigation22"
    And I should see "Investigation23"
    And I should see "Investigation24"
    And the checkbox for "drafts too:" should be checked
    When I uncheck "drafts too:"
